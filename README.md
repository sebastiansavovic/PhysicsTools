# PhysicsTools
### This project is my final project for DePaul's CSC-491
Important note, the code is GPL with exception to any of the sprites that I do make any claim to. Hopefully I will replacement soon with creative commons alternatives, but that is not the case as of this writting. The code was entirely written by me. 

This project uses: 
- [Spritekit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/) 
  - Drawing
  - Physics
- [CoreMotion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion)
  - Allowing interaction via gyro
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
    - General UI
- [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity)
    - Experimental multiplayer
- JSON
  - Level definitions
- Dependency Injection
  - Code from DITranquillity project, as the time this project was created that project did not work the way I wanted to so I took the relevant section and pasted it into my with modifications.
- Art assets from a famous game. Was put in place for the assignment not to be dull but I intent to replace them.
- Zip 
  - zip utility to store various sample levels to be decompressed to user directory at start up
  - Integration with the File app by exposing the contents of the directory to the File app so user can share their levels and place them in there for loading
